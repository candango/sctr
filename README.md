# Supervisor Controller


## Introduction

The sctr is a supervisor controller that gives non-privileged users access to
start stop their applications. The secondary goal is to create a workflow where
a privileged user create new applications.

Probably this project will grow to be a full supervisord controller, but we'll
stick to the initial and secondary goals right now.
